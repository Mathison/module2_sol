     Yelp's website, Yelp.com, is a crowd-sourced local business review and social networking site.[5] Its user community is primarily active in major metropolitan areas.[10] The site has pages devoted to individual locations, such as restaurants or schools, where Yelp users can submit a review of their products or services[65] using a one to five star rating system.[10] Businesses can also update contact information, hours and other basic listing information or add special deals.[10][15] In addition to writing reviews, users can react to reviews, plan events or discuss their personal lives.[5] According to Sterling Market Intelligence, Yelp is "one of the most important sites on the Internet."[22] As of Q2 2016 it has 168 million monthly unique visitors and 108 million reviews.[66]
78 percent of businesses listed on the site have a rating of three stars or better,[67] but some negative reviews are very personal or extreme.[10] Many reviews are written in an entertaining or creative manner.[11] Users can give a review a "thumbs-up" if it is "useful, funny or cool."[68] Each day a "Review of the Day" is determined based on a vote by users.[69]
As of June 2016, 72 percent of Yelp searches are done from a mobile device.[67] The Yelp iPhone app was introduced in December 2008.[70] In August 2009, Yelp released an update to the iPhone app with a hidden Easter Egg augmented reality feature called Monocle, which allowed users looking through their iPhone camera to see Yelp data on businesses seen through the camera.[71] Check-in features were added in 2010.[72][73]
Yelp users can make restaurant reservations in Yelp through Yelp Reservations, a feature originally added in June 2010.[74][75] Yelp's reservation features were initially done through a 2010 partnership with OpenTable,[76] but Yelp became increasingly competitive with OpenTable after Yelp's 2013 acquisition of SeatMe, resulting in the end of the partnership in April 2015.[77] SeatMe was reworked into the current "Yelp Reservations" feature.[78] In 2013, features to have food ordered and delivered were added to Yelp[79] as well as the ability to view hygiene inspection scores[80] and make appointments at spas.[81] Yelp's content was integrated into the mapping and directions app of Apple's September 2012 release of iOS 6.[82] Yelp also has features for finding local businesses offering special deals to Yelp users.[83]
In March 2014, Yelp added features for ordering and scheduling manicures, flowers, golf and legal consultations, among other things, through Yelp.[84] In October 2014, the company, working in collaboration with hotel search site Hipmunk, added features to book hotels through Yelp.[81]
On February 14, 2017, Yelp launched a Yelp Questions and Answers, new feature that allows the users to ask venue specific questions related to businesses.[85] It allows users to upvote and downvote the answers on the basis of helpfulness.[86]
Features for businesses[edit]
Yelp added the ability for business owners to respond to reviews in 2008.[10][87] Businesses can respond privately by messaging the reviewer or publicly on their profile page. In some cases, Yelp users that had a bad experience have updated their reviews more favorably due to the businesses' efforts to make it right. In other cases disputes between reviewers and business owners have led to harassment and physical altercations.[10] The system has led to criticisms that business owners can bribe reviewers with free food or discounts to increase their rating, though Yelp users say this rarely occurs.[69] A business owner can "claim" a profile, which allows them to respond to reviews and see traffic reports.[10] Businesses can also offer discounts to Yelp users that visit often using the "check in" feature.[72][73] In 2014, Yelp released an app for business owners to respond to reviews and manage their profiles from a mobile device.[88] Business owners can also flag a review to be removed, if the review violates Yelp's content guidelines.[89]
Yelp's revenues primarily come from selling ads and sponsored listings to small businesses.[8][10] Advertisers can pay to have their listing appear at the top of search results, or feature ads on the pages of their competitors.[10][15][87] As of 2016, advertising revenue was growing at a rate of 30% year over year.[90] Yelp will only allow businesses with at least a three-star rating to sign up for advertising.[11] Originally a sponsored "favorite review" could place a positive review above negative ones,[10] but Yelp stopped offering this option in 2010 in an effort to deter misconceptions that advertisers were able to marginalize negative reviews for pay.[91][92]
